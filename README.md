# Project "100 Days of Coding: JavaScript"

Iâ€™ve recently decided to brush up on my programming skills and started a 100 Days of Code challenge. Iâ€™m following Jonas Schmedtmannâ€™s [JavaScript course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course).

**Why JavaScript?** I find it fun and practical â€” especially for automating tasks in my business.

I actually started this course two years ago but never finished it. Back then, I was just launching my business and didnâ€™t have the time to practice or apply what I learned.

This time, Iâ€™m giving it a proper go. Letâ€™s see how far I can get! ðŸš€
