# 100 Days of Code - JavaScript

I chose to develop a habit of coding in 2023. The objectives are similar to the [#100DaysOfCode challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com): to code a minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days. But instead of tweeting the results, I push daily work to this repo.

Continuing with the projects from ["The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!"](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) course on Udemy.
